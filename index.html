        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class selector.</li>
          <li>Any HTML element assigned to the class selector, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>Using conditional statements such as "if" statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly brackets.</li>
          <li>But if the condition is not truthy, the code will not execute, interrupting the control flow.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>The location of the data item in the array is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop contains the following three important statements: starting point for our loop, condition, and what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
          <li>To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>When we create a function, we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and giving it a unique name.</li>
          <li>You must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
